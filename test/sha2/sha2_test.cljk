  "Runtime-agnostic SHA-2 suite.

   Constants are pinned by *digests*, not by a checksum of the table: FIPS 180-4
   publishes no check value for the round constants, so the guarantee comes from
   NIST's own test vectors plus a length sweep. One wrong constant changes every
   digest, so this is a strong pin — and the oracle suite adds a sweep against a
   reference implementation over hundreds of inputs."
